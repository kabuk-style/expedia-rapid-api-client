  # Retrieve Booking
  # This API call returns itinerary details and links to resume or cancel the booking. There are two methods to retrieve a booking: * Using the link included in the original Book response, example: https://api.ean.com/v3/itineraries/8955599932111?token&#x3D;QldfCGlcUA4GXVlSAQ4W * Using the email of the booking. If the email contains special characters, they must be encoded to successfully retrieve the booking. Example: https://api.ean.com/v3/itineraries/8955599932111?email&#x3D;customer@email.com  &lt;i&gt;Note: Newly created itineraries may sometimes have a small delay between the time of creation and the time that the itinerary can be retrieved. If you receive an error when trying to retrieve an itinerary that was successfully created, or if you receive a response with two fields, namely, &#x60;itinerary_id&#x60; and &#x60;creation_date_time&#x60;, then please wait a few minutes before trying to retrieve the itinerary again.&lt;/i&gt;

  # @param accept_encoding Specifies the response encoding that the client would like to receive back. This must be &#x60;gzip&#x60;.

  # @option opts [String] :test The retrieve call has a test header that can be used to return set responses. Passing standard in the Test header will retrieve a test booking, and passing any of the errors listed below will return a stubbed error response that you can use to test your error handling code. Additionally, refer to the Test Request documentation for more details on how these header values are used. * &#x60;standard&#x60; - Requires valid test booking. * &#x60;service_unavailable&#x60; * &#x60;internal_server_error&#x60;

  # @option opts [Array<String>] :include Options for which information to return in the response. The value must be lower case. * &#x60;history&#x60; - Include itinerary history, showing details of the changes made to this itinerary.
