  # unit tests for get_additional_availability
  # Get additional property room rates and availability
  # Returns additional rates on available room types, using the parameters of the previous call.  The response includes rate details such as promos, whether the rate is refundable, cancellation penalties and a full price breakdown to meet the price display requirements for your market. _Note_: If there are no available rooms, the response will be an empty array. * The &#x60;nightly&#x60; array includes each individual night&#39;s charges. When the total price includes fees, charges, or adjustments that are not divided by night, these amounts will be included in the &#x60;stay&#x60; rate array, which details charges applied to the entire stay (each check-in).

  # @param user_agent The &#x60;User-Agent&#x60; header string from the customer&#39;s request, as captured by your integration. If you are building an application then the &#x60;User-Agent&#x60; value should be &#x60;{app name}/{app version}&#x60;.
