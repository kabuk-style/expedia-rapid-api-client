  # Create Booking
  # This link will be available in the Price Check response or in the register payments response when Two-Factor Authentication is used. It returns an itinerary id and links to retrieve reservation details, cancel a held booking, resume a held booking or complete payment session. Please note that depending on the state of the booking, the response will contain only the applicable link(s). 
  # @param accept Specifies the response format that the client would like to receive back. This must be &#x60;application/json&#x60;. 
  # @param accept_encoding Specifies the response encoding that the client would like to receive back. This must be &#x60;gzip&#x60;. 
  # @param content_type This parameter is to specify what format the request body is in. The only supported value is application/json. 
  # @param customer_ip IP address of the customer, as captured by your integration.&lt;br&gt; Ensure your integration passes the customer&#39;s IP, not your own. This value helps determine their location and assign the correct payment gateway.&lt;br&gt; Also used for fraud recovery and other important analytics. 
  # @param user_agent The &#x60;User-Agent&#x60; header string from the customer&#39;s request, as captured by your integration. If you are building an application then the &#x60;User-Agent&#x60; value should be &#x60;{app name}/{app version}&#x60;. 
  # @param token Provided as part of the link object and used to maintain state across calls. This simplifies each subsequent call by limiting the amount of information required at each step and reduces the potential for errors. Token values cannot be viewed or changed. 
  # @param create_itinerary_request 
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :customer_session_id Insert your own unique value for each user session, beginning with the first API call. Continue to pass the same value for each subsequent API call during the user&#39;s session, using a new value for every new customer session.&lt;br&gt; Including this value greatly eases EPS&#39;s internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user&#39;s session. 
  # @option opts [String] :test The book call has a test header that can be used to return set responses with the following keywords:&lt;br&gt; * &#x60;standard&#x60; * &#x60;complete_payment_session&#x60; * &#x60;service_unavailable&#x60; * &#x60;internal_server_error&#x60; * &#x60;price_mismatch&#x60; * &#x60;cc_declined&#x60; * &#x60;rooms_unavailable&#x60;

  # Register Payments
  # &lt;b&gt;This link only applies to transactions where EPS takes the customer&#39;s payment information.

It returns a payment session ID and a link to create a booking. This will be the first step in the booking flow only if you&#39;ve opted into Two-Factor Authentication to comply with the September 2019 EU Regulations for PSD2.
