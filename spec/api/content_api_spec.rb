  # unit tests for get_chain_reference
  # Chain Reference
  # Returns a complete collection of chains recognized by the Rapid API. &lt;br&gt;Chains represent a parent company which can have multiple brands associated with it. A brand can only be associated with one chain. For example, Hilton Worldwide is a chain that has multiple associated brands including DoubleTree, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites. &lt;br&gt;The response is a JSON map where the key is the chain ID and the value is a chain object. Each chain object also contains a map of its related brands. &lt;br&gt;Note that the set of chain IDs and brand IDs are totally independent of one another. It is possible for a chain and a brand to both use the same number as their ID, but this is just a coincidence that holds no meaning. &lt;br&gt;Chain and brand names are provided in English only.
